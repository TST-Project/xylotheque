# Xylothèque : bois tropicaux — index of tropical wood species

https://tst-project.github.io/xylotheque/

This index has been built from the photographs of wood samples at CIRAD, as archived by the BnF. Clicking on a photograph will bring up its description in the list. Clicking on the list headings will sort the list as well as the photographs.

The initial inspiration for this project was to make a tool to help visually identify the wood species of the wood covers of palm leaf manuscripts.
